### Assignments

#### Week Two
1. **Assignment 1**: Implement a singly linked list class with the following methods:
   - `append(data)`: Adds a new node with the specified data at the end of the list.
   - `prepend(data)`: Adds a new node with the specified data at the beginning of the list.
   - `print_list()`: Prints all the elements in the list.
2. **Assignment 2**: Implement a method `remove(data)` in the LinkedList class that removes the first occurrence of a node with the specified data.
3. **Assignment 3**: Implement a basic queue using Python's built-in list data structure with methods `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `is_empty`, and `size`.
4. **Assignment 4**: Use Python's `collections.deque` to implement a more efficient queue.

#### Week Three
5. **Assignment 5**: Implement a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
6. **Assignment 6**: Implement a recursive function to compute the nth Fibonacci number.

#### Week Four
- **Discussion 4**: Focus on Notations and *args, **kwargs.
- **Discussion 5**: Discuss pattern searching, regex, and its uses in Python.

#### Week Five
7. **Assignment 7**: Implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.
8. **Assignment 8**: Implement the Quick Sort algorithm.
9. **Assignment 9**: Implement the Merge Sort algorithm.

#### Week Six
10. **Assignment 10**: Implement a basic binary tree with methods for in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal.
11. **Assignment 11**: Implement a binary search tree (BST) with methods for inserting nodes and searching for values.
12. **Assignment 12**: Implement depth-first search (DFS) methods for a binary tree using an iterative approach.

### Student Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of nodes in data structures.
- Learn how to implement linked lists and their variations.
- Implement basic and advanced queue operations.
- Use stacks and stack-based algorithms effectively.
- Implement hash maps for various problem-solving scenarios.
- Implement recursive solutions and analyze their efficiency.
- Analyze algorithmic complexities using asymptotic notation.
- Apply pattern searching algorithms to real-world problems.
- Implement and compare sorting algorithms.
- Implement and manipulate binary trees, AVL trees, and other tree structures.
- Apply divide-and-conquer strategies to solve complex problems.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python 3.x**: All examples are developed in Python 3.x.
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: I used Visual Studio Code and PyCharm, but any Python-compatible IDE will work.
- **Git**: Version control and collaboration through GitHub.

### How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skyla643/Python-2-class.git
   ```
2. Navigate through the folders to find specific projects, lessons, or exercises.
3. Run any Python file using:
   ```bash
   python <filename>.py
   ```
4. Use the **lessons** as a reference to understand each concept, then try the **exercises** for hands-on practice.

### Future Goals
The goal of Python 2 is to prepare for more advanced programming topics, including automation, data analysis, and exploring Python's powerful libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
